This is a python language CLI port for another program I wrote in C# a long while ago ( https://github.com/EffortlessTurtle/Wanorexia ).
It will recursively move down a file tree and consolidate all of the files down from the user-defined target position into a single, user-defined folder.
Very handy for certain applications

Have fun!

Special thanks to Ray!
